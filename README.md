# Temperature converter :thermometer:

In this project, I am for the first time combining my html and css knowledge with some javascript content, to make a website "do" something.
I'm using youtube videos and articles found on Google as help, as well as chat gpt (version 3.5).
Plus my own knowledge from the multiple codecademy and ironhack courses I have done in the past few months.
